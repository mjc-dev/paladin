// The implementation is not required to know how to generate or validate such data, just how
// to securely store and retrieve it using only the information contained in the returned
// keyHandle. If the implementation finds it does not exist, it can invoke the callback function to generate
// a new suitable random string to encrypt and store.

// Some cryptographic stores are capable of listing their contents in a natural order.
//
// It is a friendly behavior particularly at development/exploration time to be able to present
// these keys back as key mappings automatically, simply picking a name for them that
// is intuitive based on the store in the backend.
//
// The backend store is not responsible for any fancy query/sort capabilities - as the listing
// is only used to build the key mapping entries into Paladin.
// The only requirements are:
// 1) that there is a natural order
// 2) that there is a finite list (thus this is NOT supported by the HD Wallet derivation scheme if used in the signing module on top of a key store)
// 3) that when presented with the nextPtr from the last call, the listing can continue to list keys after that point (according to the natural order)
//
// This behavior can be explicitly disabled in the configuration for any store type.

// Some cryptographic storage systems, in particular Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Cloud HSM systems,
// support signing directly with certain curves.
//
// This is an advanced feature of key store implementations, and hence kept on a separate interface.
//
// Configuring a signing module in this way provides enhanced security. However, it disables use of any
// of the in-memory signing capabilities of the signing module - such as ZKP proof generation using in-memory keys.
//
// Note that even HSM based key storage systems support storage and retrieval of a key (by encrypting and
// decrypting that key on storage and retrieval). So a signing-capable system (such as a HSM or Cloud HSM)
// might still be used with this in-memory module by installing the code in this repo close to the HSM.
//
// See the Paladin architecture docs for more details.
